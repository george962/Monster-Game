# Monster-Game

This is a project that I did for my AP Computer Science class in high school. The idea of the game is 3x5 gride where you start in the bottom left corner. From there, your goal is to navigate through the gride and get to the "prize". Each step of the way you are given the option of moving right or left, and the only time you can move up/down between each floor is if there are stairs. In addition, there are monsters you need to fight. To get past the monster you need a sword in order to defeat it.

Overall, this game was fun to code. I learned to think in depth of each command with the if/elif/else statements. The biggest challenge I faced was trying to understand the assignment at the time.
